# Getting started

The CLI project isn’t public yet; see our [contributing guide](./contributing) for now. When the CLI project is public, we’ll write some documentation here on how to create a new project using it. It’ll be something like this:

```sh
npm create @observablehq
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

```sh
npm run build
```
